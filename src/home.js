                            <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                                It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

                            <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
                                HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

                            <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
                                HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>
                            <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
                                Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</p>
